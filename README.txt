	Added 2 Woocommerce templates to the them so that I could add in 
	sidebar support for the catalogue page remove the sidebar from the single 
	product page
	
	Made some small css change to the woocommerce site as - images were 
	in percentages to allow the site to be responsive, this was making the 
	images scale larger than they were and they were blurring.
	
	Added custom template for the shop and created two sidebars, one for the 
	catalogue page and one for the general shop page so that users can add 
	widgets that are relevant to each area. All the woocommerce pages except

	Starkers is a bare-bones WordPress theme 
	created to act as a starting point for the 
	theme designer. Free of all style, 
	presentational elements, and non-semantic 
	markup, Starkers is the perfect ‘blank slate’ 
	for all your WordPress projects.

	Best of all: it’s free and fully GPL-licensed, 
	so you can use it for whatever you like — even 
	commercial work.

	Up until now, Starkers has merely been a 
	stripped-back version of the default theme 
	that ships with WordPress, and as a result has 
	never been quite as ‘naked’ as it could be. 
	Now we’ve brought it under the Viewport 
	Industries banner and have rebuilt it from the 
	ground up. Literally. Not one line of code is 
	the same.
